# Dhupee's Nix configurations Repository (EXPERIMENTAL)

This is my Nix configurations, which "will" be part of my dotfiles. These are configurations that I currently created on my Nix dotfiles, not only for NixOS, but also for Android, and maybe hopefully servers and Macs if i have money.

It's still experimental, since I havent move to NixOS yet, but it should be good enough for now.

## File Structure

This is how I structure my dotfiles currently, it might will have few directories, maybe regarding theming, users, or something else in the future.

```txt
